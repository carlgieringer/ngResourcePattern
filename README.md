An application exemplifying a pattern for using AngularJS ngResource with RESTful entities.
For details see [the blog post](http://carlgieringer.com/blog/a-pattern-for-using-angularjs-resource-with-restful-entities).

To run the application, run `grunt` and point a web browser at localhost:8080.
This will run a simple server with basic static file capabilities and in-memory
storage of entities created.
